# Today's Agenda

- [Rstudio Shiny Lesson 5 (10 min)](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson5/)
- [Leaflet + Shiny Relationship (15 min)](#leaflet-and-shiny-relationship)
- [Shiny dashboard (25 min)](#shiny-dashboards)
- [Brief discussion of proposed demo applications (10 min)](#proposed-demo-applications)

# [Lesson 5 - R Scripts and Data](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson5/)

Refer to the [linked article.](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson5/).

## Bryan's Notes:

- You'll notice the tutorial uses `.rds` files. If you are not familiar with these, these files a binary data format that R can read and write quickly. They are great for Shiny apps because they load quickly, as opposed to an Excel file, which has to be run through the `read_excel()` function and takes more time to parse. `.rds` files can load nearly instantaneously for small files, and for large files offer a significant speed advantage over other formats. 
- You'll also notice that the tutorial makes use of the `source()` command to load a function from a separate `.R` file. It is sometimes convenient, for a variety of reasons, to build functions or script procedures in other files to be loaded into the Shiny environment. This enables you to use the same script/functions across multiple projects, and, depending upon the application design, speed up your processing if you are not defining procedures within the Shiny context. 
- When operating in the Shiny environment, all paths are relative to the folder containing the Shiny application. It is often helpful for me to have a commented out `setwd()` command for when I am testing pieces of the app so that I am operating in the same directory the application will be. 
- We are recommending the use of `ui.R`, `server.R`, and `global.R` files for developing Shiny applications. This means your data loading and function/script loading can be happening in the `global.R` file. 

# [Leaflet and Shiny Relationship](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html)

Refer to the [linked article.](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/shiny.html)

## Bryan's Notes:

- Note that you *can* set up a shiny app without the `session` parameter referenced in the definition function, but to use the `leaflet` features you will need to reference `session`. 
- `leafletProxy()` is used to change the features plotted on a leaflet map without generating a new `leaflet()` object, so the extents and zoom will not re-generate. This is helpful for changing the features (or their colors, for example) on a map based on user input. 
- One of the key elements of using a `leafletProxy()` is using identifiers for features. This is genuinely good practice for data analysis anyways, so make sure you have unique identifiers for each of your geographic features/observations. 
- Check out the [SuperZip](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html) example fo demonstrating the use of interactivity with leaflet and Shiny. See the [code](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/master/063-superzip-example) to see how `leafletProxy()`s,layer IDs and click events are used. 

# [Shiny Dashboards](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard)

Refer to [linked articles.](https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html)

## Bryan's Notes

- The `shinydashboard` package makes some quick aesthetic and functional features of data dashboards quick to implement and customize. That said, there are times when you will want to customize the aesthetics of a dashboard more than the package will let you -- in this case you may want to build some of the functions of the dashboard from scratch. For this course, we want our demo applications to be relatively simple, so I would recommend using `shinydashboard`. 
- Bryan to show code underyling the current iteration of the Vancouver crash dashboard. The live application lives [here](https://nelsonnygaard.shinyapps.io/vancouver_crash_dashboard/) and the code for the application is available at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/PerkinsAndWill/Vancouver_TSP/tree/master/vancouver_crash_dashboard). 

# [Proposed Demo Applications](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13299ksP-588xCqw-Bu0RO7IDk9gFEfoKvcbAgZNlTcg/edit#gid=0)

Participants in the course have proposed their demo Shiny applications at the [linked Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13299ksP-588xCqw-Bu0RO7IDk9gFEfoKvcbAgZNlTcg/edit#gid=0). Let's have a brief discussion about what special tools people might need for their apps and what challenges you see yourself running into. 

Please schedule one-on-ones with me as needed to ask questions or bounce ideas off me specific to your application. I will try to share notes out from one-on-ones that I think will be useful to multiple people.
