I don't know how consistently most people write methodology memos, or even take notes. I'd like some of the best ones to be stored on the G drive so, for example, if I want to do a similar transit market analysis to what Suzie has done in Boston, I can easily find detailed documentation of it.\",\"Some how to guides for how to work across ArcMap -&gt; R -&gt; Illustrator would be helpful. I've found the workflow of creating maps and/or graphics in R and exporting to an svg so they can be used in illustrator has been really nice, for example. I used this workflow with Layne on COIC Redmond and it worked well. There are some tips and tricks to help, like keeping the map extent constant if generating a series, that are not always obvious.    I think some simple how-to's or catalogues of code snippets for R would be helpful. I'm thinking especially of things that should be quick but can take too long to remember how to do if you don't do them often, like how to create a palette to use with R Leaflet or certain ggplot options.
