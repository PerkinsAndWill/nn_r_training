## Introduction

The [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) is a 'universe' of packages designed for data science with R. They are all built with an underlying design philosophy and grammar based on the [concept of 'tidy' data](https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). This session will discuss the tidy data concept and its main package implementations. For me, the tidy data concept influences not just the work I do in R but how I structure spreadsheets and datasets in general, and I have found it to generally result in cleaner data analyses.[Tidyverse packages](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/) are among the most used R packages, and greatly improve upon implementations of basic operations in base R. The Tidyverse chapter will greatly draw upon Hadley Wickham's (the progenitor of the Tidyverse) book (available for free online), [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

Hadley proposes a model that nearly all data science projects adhere to, described by the below illustration. In this module, we will mostly be discussing the Import and Tidy aspects, but in other course modules we will be delving into Transform, Visualize, Model, and Communicate parts of a data science workflow.

## Tidyverse Packages

As mentioned above, the Tidyverse consists of a collection of R packages -- several of the key packages will briefly be explained below.
