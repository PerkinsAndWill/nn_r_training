# Introduction

## The General Transit Feed Specification

The [summary page for the GTFS standard](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/#overview-of-a-gtfs-feed) is a good resource for more information on the standard. GTFS was developed as a standardized way of publishing transit information for consumption by third-party applications (e.g., Google Maps). It is was originally [developed as a collaboration between Google and TriMet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Transit_Feed_Specification), and became an open source definition for transit information around the world.  What is still often referred to as GTFS is now more specifically referred to as GTFS static, because there are additional data feeds related to GTFS that transit agencies use, including GTFS-realtime, which provides realtime vehicle positioning and arrival estimates to third party applications (e.g., Google Maps, Transit). 

GTFS provides a standard way to describe transit networks that is useful for NN's analyses -- because of GTFS's standardization, many blocks of code can be re-used between projects for specific agencies. It is also always publicly available by its nature (i.e. it is published to a public web location for apps to consume), and so there is no need to request route/stop/schedule/etc. information from a client. You just need to figure out which version of the GTFS feed you want to use for your analysis. 

GTFS feeds contain many linked tables about published transit schedules about service schedules, trips, stops, and routes. Below is a diagram of these relationships and tables:

## Read a GTFS Feed

GTFS data come packaged as a zip file of tables in text form. The first thing tidytransit does is consolidate the reading of all those tables into a single R object, which contains a list of the tables in each feed. Below we use the tidytransit `read_gtfs` function in order to read a feed from TriMet into R. 

I downloaded this feed to this course module's data folder prior to running this code -- you could also read the ZIP file directly from a public web url. 
This is useful because there are many sources for GTFS data, and often the best source is transit service providers themselves. See the next section on "Finding More GTFS Feeds" for more sources of feeds. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(tidytransit)
library(lubridate)
library(leaflet)

pdx <- read_gtfs("data/trimet_gtfs.zip")
```

You can use `summary` to get an overview of the feed.

```{r}
summary(pdx)
```

Each of the source tables for the GTFS feed is now available in the nyc `gtfs` object. For
example, stops:

```{r}
head(pdx$stops)
```

The tables available on each feed may vary. Below we can simply print the names of all the 
tables that were read in for this feed. Each of these is a table.

```{r}
names(pdx)
```

## Finding GTFS Feeds

You can find current GTFS feeds through the `tidytransit` package directly as described on the [documentation website](http://tidytransit.r-transit.org/articles/introduction.html). Nevertheless, I like to browse the feeds at [transitfeeds.com](http://transitfeeds.com/), because this lets me easily browse for the specific vintage of feed that I am interested in. GTFS feeds are updated fairly often, especially for large agencies. This means that you may want to look at a previous version of the feed for your analysis, because schedules, routes, stops, or identifiers may have changed. 

# Understanding Service Periods

## Overview

Each trip in a GTFS feed is referenced to a service_id (in trips.txt). The [GTFS reference](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/#calendartxt) 
specifies that a "service_id contains an ID that uniquely identifies a set of dates when 
service is available for one or more routes". A service could run on every weekday or only 
on Saturdays for example. Other possible services run only on holidays during a year, 
independent of weekdays. However, feeds are not required to indicate anything with 
service_ids and some feeds even use a unique service_id for each trip and day. In 
this vignette we'll look at a general way to gather information on when trips run by 
using "service patterns".

Service patterns can be used to find a typical day for further analysis like routing or
trip frequencies for different days.

## Prepare data

We're going to again be using TriMet for our example. 
  
```{r}
gtfs <- read_gtfs("data/trimet_gtfs.zip")
```
  
With `set_date_service_table()` we add a table to the feed that indicates which `service_id` 
runs on which date. This is later useful for linking dates and trips via `service_id`. 

```{r}
gtfs <- set_date_service_table(gtfs)
head(gtfs$.$date_service_table)
```

To understand service patterns better we need information on weekdays and holidays. With 
a calendar table we know the weekday and possible holidays for each date. We'll use a minimal example 
with two holidays for Thanksgiving and Black Friday.

```{r}
holidays = tribble(~date, ~holiday,
  ymd("2020-11-26"), "Thanksgiving",
  ymd("2020-11-27"), "Black Friday")
calendar = tibble(date = unique(gtfs$.$date_service_table$date)) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday = (function(date) {
      c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", 
        "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", 
        "Saturday")[as.POSIXlt(date)$wday + 1]
    })(date)
  )
calendar <- calendar %>% left_join(holidays, by = "date")
head(calendar)
```

To analyze on which dates trips run and to group similar services we use service patterns. 
Such a pattern simply lists all dates a trip runs on. For example, a trip with a pattern 
like _2019-03-07, 2019-03-14, 2019-03-21, 2019-03-28_ runs every Thursday in March 2019. 
To handle these patterns we create a `servicepattern_id` using a hash function. Ideally there are 
the same number of servicepattern_ids and service_ids. However, in real life feeds, this is rarely 
the case. In addition, the usability of service patterns depends largely on the feed and its 
complexity.

```{r}
gtfs <- set_servicepattern(gtfs)
```

Our gtfs feed now contains the data frame `service_pattern` which links each `servicepattern_id`
to an existing `service_id` (and by extension `trip_id`). 

```{r}
head(gtfs$.$service_pattern)
```

In addition, `gtfs$.$date_servicepattern_table` has been created which connects dates and service 
patterns (like `date_service_table`). We can compare the number of service patterns to the number of services.

```{r}
# service ids used
n_services <-  length(unique(gtfs$trips$service_id)) # 31
# unique date patterns 
n_servicepatterns <- length(unique(gtfs$.$service_pattern$servicepattern_id)) # 16
```

The feed uses 31 service_ids but there are actually only 16 different date patterns. Other feeds 
might not have such low numbers, for example the [Swiss GTFS feed](https://opentransportdata.swiss/dataset/timetable-2019-gtfs) 
uses around 15,600 service_ids which all identify unique date patterns.

## Analyze Data

### Exploration Plot

We'll now try to figure out usable names for those patterns. A good way to start is visualizing the data.

```{r fig.height=6, fig.width=10}
date_servicepattern_table <- gtfs$.$date_servicepattern_table %>% left_join(calendar, by = "date")
ggplot(date_servicepattern_table) + theme_bw() + 
  geom_point(aes(x = date, y = servicepattern_id, color = weekday), size = 1) + 
  scale_x_date(breaks = scales::date_breaks("1 month")) + theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

The plot shows that pattern `s_128de43` runs on every Sunday from July until October without 
exceptions. `s_a4c6b26` also runs on Sundays but it also covers a Monday (September 3rd). 
Similarly, the date pattern `s_f3bcc6f` runs every Saturday. `s_d7d9701` covers weekdays 
(Mondays through Friday), `s_e25d6ca` seems to do the same through November with some exceptions. 

### Names for service patterns

It's generally difficult to automatically generate readable names for service patterns. Below you 
see a semi automated approach with some heuristics. However, the workflow depends largely on the 
feed and its structure. You might also consider setting names completely manually.

```{r}
suggest_servicepattern_name = function(dates, calendar) {
  servicepattern_calendar = tibble(date = dates) %>% left_join(calendar, by = "date")
  
  # all normal dates without holidays
  calendar_normal = servicepattern_calendar %>% filter(is.na(holiday))
  
  # create a frequency table for all calendar dates without holidays
  weekday_freq = sort(table(calendar_normal$weekday), decreasing = T)
  n_weekdays = length(weekday_freq)
  
  # all holidays that are not covered by normal weekdays anyways
  calendar_holidays <- servicepattern_calendar %>% filter(!is.na(holiday)) %>% filter(!(weekday %in% names(weekday_freq)))
  if(n_weekdays == 7) {
    pattern_name = "Every day"
  }
  # Single day service
  else if(n_weekdays == 1) {
    wd = names(weekday_freq)[1]
    # while paste0(weekday, "s") is easier, this solution can be used for other languages
    pattern_name = c("Sunday"  = "Sundays", 
        "Monday"    = "Mondays", 
        "Tuesday"   = "Tuesdays", 
        "Wednesday" = "Wednesdays",
        "Thursday"  = "Thursdays",  
        "Friday"    = "Fridays",  
        "Saturday"  = "Saturdays")[wd]
  } 
  # Weekday Service
  else if(n_weekdays == 5 && 
      length(intersect(names(weekday_freq), 
        c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"))) == 5) {
    pattern_name = "Weekdays"
  }
  # Weekend
  else if(n_weekdays == 2 && 
      length(intersect(names(weekday_freq), c("Saturday", "Sunday"))) == 2) {
    pattern_name = "Weekends"
  }
  # Multiple weekdays that appear regularly
  else if(n_weekdays >= 2 && (max(weekday_freq) - min(weekday_freq)) <= 1) {
    wd = names(weekday_freq)
    ordered_wd = wd[order(match(wd, c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday")))]
    pattern_name = paste(ordered_wd, collapse = ", ")
  } 
  # default
  else {
    pattern_name = paste(weekday_freq, names(weekday_freq), sep = "x ", collapse = ", ")
  }
  
  # add holidays
  if(nrow(calendar_holidays) > 0) {
    pattern_name <- paste0(pattern_name, " and ", paste(calendar_holidays$holiday, collapse = ", "))
  }
  
  pattern_name <- paste0(pattern_name, " (", min(dates), " - ", max(dates), ")") 
  return(pattern_name)
}
```

We'll apply this function to our service patterns and create a table with ids and names.

```{r}
servicepattern_names = gtfs$.$date_servicepattern_table %>% 
  group_by(servicepattern_id) %>% summarise(
    servicepattern_name = suggest_servicepattern_name(date, calendar)
  )
print(servicepattern_names)
```

## Visualize services

### Plot calendar for each service pattern

We can plot the service pattern like a calendar to visualise the different patterns. The original 
services can be plotted similarly (given it's not too many) by using `date_service_table` and `service_id`.

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=15}
dates = gtfs$.$date_servicepattern_table
dates$wday <- lubridate::wday(dates$date, label = T, abbr = T, week_start = 7)
dates$week_nr <- lubridate::week(dates$date)
dates <- dates %>% group_by(week_nr) %>% summarise(week_first_date = min(date)) %>% right_join(dates, by = "week_nr")
week_labels = dates %>% select(week_nr, week_first_date) %>% unique()
ggplot(dates) + theme_bw() +
  geom_tile(aes(x = wday, y = week_nr), color = "#747474") +
  scale_x_discrete(drop = F) +
  scale_y_continuous(trans = "reverse", labels = week_labels$week_first_date, breaks = week_labels$week_nr) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Date of Sundays") +
  facet_wrap(~servicepattern_id, nrow = 1)
```

### Plot number of trips per day as calendar

We can plot the number of trips for each day as a calendar heat map.

```{r fig.height=8, fig.width=10}
trips_servicepattern = left_join(select(gtfs$trips, trip_id, service_id), gtfs$.$service_pattern, by = "service_id")
trip_dates = left_join(gtfs$.$date_servicepattern_table, trips_servicepattern, by = "servicepattern_id")
trip_dates_count = trip_dates %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(count = dplyr::n()) 
trip_dates_count$weekday <- lubridate::wday(trip_dates_count$date, label = T, abbr = T, week_start = 7)
trip_dates_count$day_of_month <- lubridate::day(trip_dates_count$date)
trip_dates_count$first_day_of_month <- lubridate::wday(trip_dates_count$date - trip_dates_count$day_of_month,  week_start = 7)
trip_dates_count$week_of_month <- ceiling((trip_dates_count$day_of_month - as.numeric(trip_dates_count$weekday) - trip_dates_count$first_day_of_month) / 7)
trip_dates_count$month <- lubridate::month(trip_dates_count$date, label = T, abbr = F)
ggplot(trip_dates_count, aes(x = weekday, y = -week_of_month)) + theme_bw() +
  geom_tile(aes(fill = count, colour = "grey50")) +
  geom_text(aes(label = day_of_month), size = 3, colour = "grey20") +
  facet_wrap(~month, ncol = 3) +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "cornsilk1", high = "DarkOrange", na.value="white")+
    scale_color_manual(guide = F, values = "grey50") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank()) +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank()) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = "# trips") +
  coord_fixed()
```

# Headway Mapping

## Import Transit Data (GTFS)

We'll again start by importing a snapshot of TriMet's GTFS.

```{r}
gtfs <- read_gtfs("data/trimet_gtfs.zip")
```

## Identify Weekday Schedules of Service

GTFS feeds typically contain a schedule of all the schedules of service for a given system. Selecting a schedule of service in Portland allows us to focus on, for example, non-holiday weekday service, in the Fall of 2020. In some feeds, service selection can be more or less complicated than Portland. In any case, the work we did above in identifying service patterns is helpful. 

```{r}
gtfs <- set_servicepattern(gtfs)
```

After setting the service patterns, we can summarise each service by the number of trips and stops. We'll also summarise the total distance covered by all trips in the service, and then check that against the total distance covered by the average route. First, we need to calculate the distance of each part of the route shapes.  

```{r}
shp1 <- shapes_as_sf(gtfs$shapes)
shp1 <- st_transform(shp1, crs=2269)
shp1$length <- st_length(shp1)
shp2 <- shp1 %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  select(shape_id,length,-geometry) 
```

Now we're ready to roll the statistics up to services. 

```{r}
service_pattern_summary <- gtfs$trips %>%
  left_join(gtfs$.$service_pattern, by="service_id") %>% 
  left_join(shp2, by="shape_id") %>%
  left_join(gtfs$stop_times, by="trip_id") %>% 
  group_by(servicepattern_id) %>% 
  summarise(trips = n(), 
            routes = n_distinct(route_id),
            total_distance_per_day_mile = sum(as.numeric(length), 
                                    na.rm=TRUE)/5280,
            route_avg_distance_mile = (sum(as.numeric(length),
                                    na.rm=TRUE)/5280)/(trips*routes),
            stops=(n_distinct(stop_id)/2))
```

We can also add the number of days that each service is in operation. 

```{r}
service_pattern_summary <- gtfs$.$date_servicepattern_table %>% 
  group_by(servicepattern_id) %>% 
  summarise(days_in_service = n()) %>% 
  left_join(service_pattern_summary, by="servicepattern_id")
```

And then we'll print the summary. 

```{r}
knitr::kable(service_pattern_summary)
```

It seems that if we want to summarise the most common patterns of service in the TriMet system, we should use the `s_8646f9b` service pattern, as it has the most days in service, the most trips, stops, and routes. 

We'll use that pattern below to pull out the Service ID's that we need to use to identify trips in the GTFS feed for which we want to summarise service. 

```{r}
service_ids <- gtfs$.$service_pattern %>% 
  filter(servicepattern_id == 's_8646f9b') %>% 
  pull(service_id)
head(service_ids) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

So, what are these service_id codes? How they are put together varies from operator to operator. The important thing is that the service_id's are also a field on the `trips` table, which describes all the trips taken in the system. 

Lets see how many trips fall under each of these service_id's on the trips table, and how they relate to routes. 

```{r}
gtfs$trips %>%
  filter(service_id %in% service_ids) %>%
  group_by(service_id, route_id) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  head() %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Given the one-to-one relationship between service-id's and routes, we might conclude that the NYC Subway GTFS creates service_id's for each route that a trip runs on. Some GTFS feeds are simpler: a single service_id might relate to 'all vehicle trips running every weekdays'. Service patterns get us around complications like this by describing service in terms of exhaustive calendar dates, regardless of whether an operator may break out each route as a different service. 

## Calculate Headways

So, now that we've used service patterns to identify the set of service_id's that refer to all weekday trips, we can summarize service between 6 am and 10 am for the TriMet System on weekdays.  

```{r}
am_freq <- get_stop_frequency(gtfs, start_hour = 6, end_hour = 10, service_ids = service_ids)
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(am_freq))
```

This table includes columns for the id for a given stop, the route_id, our selected service_id's, and the number of departures and the average headway for a given direction from 6 am to 10 am on weekdays. 

The `get_stop_frequency` function simply counts the number of departures within the time frame to get departures per stop. Then, to get headways, it divides the number of minutes by the number of departures, and rounds to the nearest integer. 

Lets have a look at the headways for route 4, which runs from downtown Portland to Saint Johns, a neighborhood at the far edge of North Portland. 

First, we filter the `am_freq` data frame to just stops going in 1 direction on the 1 bus, and then we join to the original `stops` table, which includes a more descriptive stop_name. 

```{r}
one_line_stops <- am_freq %>% 
    filter(route_id==4 & direction_id==0) %>%
    left_join(gtfs$stops, by ="stop_id")
```

Lets also plot the headways at these stops on a map to see how they are distributed across the city. 
First, we'll use the `stops_as_sf` function, which converts the latitudes and longitudes on the stops table in the GTFS feed into  [simple features](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html).  

```{r}
pdx_stops_sf <- stops_as_sf(gtfs$stops)
```

Now we can join those stop coordinates to the calculated stop headways. 

```{r}
one_line_stops_sf <- pdx_stops_sf %>%
  right_join(one_line_stops, by="stop_id") 
```

And then use ggplot's `geom_sf` to plot the headways. 

```{r}
one_line_stops_sf %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(aes(color=headway)) +
  theme_bw()
```

Finally, we can easily summarise what the headways are like along the entire route now, by using r's default summary function for the vector of headways. 

```{r}
summary(one_line_stops$headway)
```

This is the same method that tidytransit uses to summarise headways along all routes in the system when we use the `get_route_frequency` function, which we'll try next.  

## Map Headways By Route

Now we'll use the `get_route_frequency` function to summarise transit service by route, for the same time period. 

```{r}
am_route_freq <- get_route_frequency(gtfs, service_ids = service_ids, start_hour = 6, end_hour = 10) 
head(am_route_freq) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

Since, under the hood, this table is a summary of stop frequencies along each route, it includes the same variables as a summary of the headways at each stop along the route, as well as a sum of all departures. Again, its important to note that this summary is based on the trips that happened within the time frame we specify. 
As with the stops, we can easily join this table to simple features and then plot it on a map. Note that here too we pass in the select service_id's from above, as the route run by a vehicle also depends on the selected service. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# get_route_geometry needs a gtfs object that includes shapes as simple feature data frames
gtfs_sf <- gtfs_as_sf(gtfs)
routes_sf <- get_route_geometry(gtfs_sf, service_ids = service_ids) 
```

Then we join the geometries to the calculated frequencies:

```{r}
routes_sf <- routes_sf %>% 
  inner_join(am_route_freq, by = 'route_id')
```

And finally, lets plot the routes with median headways of 15 minutes or less in the morning.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=4, warn=FALSE}
# convert to an appropriate coordinate reference system
 routes_sf %>% 
  filter(median_headways<=15) %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(aes(colour=as.factor(median_headways))) + 
  labs(color = "Headways") +
  geom_sf_text(aes(label=route_id)) +
  theme_bw() 
```

We can see TriMet's most frequent routes in this map. 

## Map Departures by Stop and Route

Still, we'd like to represent where and how frequently buses run in Portland in the morning. How can we do so given that, graphically, the route lines overlap?

One method might be change the units we are representing graphically. Thus far, we have used stops and routes as units. But GTFS data also come with a `shapes` table, which, in theory, should allow us to say what the frequency of vehicles passing through any given shape is, using similar methods. We're going to simplify and use transparency and lineweight to symbolize the frequency of a route using `leaflet`. 

```{r}
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles('CartoDB.Positron') %>%
  addPolylines(data = routes_sf,color='red',opacity = 0.25,
               weight =~ total_departures/100)
```

Now we have a rough representation of the question we set out to answer: where and how frequently does transit service run in the AM in Portland. Note that in this graphic, the intensity of the red tells you how many overlapping buses run through a given street and the thickness of the lines represents how many run along each line. 

We can combine this with stops to get a sense of how central stops relate to routes. 

```{r}
pdx_stop_am_departures_main <- pdx_stops_sf %>% 
  left_join(am_freq, by = "stop_id") %>% 
  filter(departures>50)
```

First, we'll leverage the common `stop_name` variable to group and count departures, in both directions, for all stops, filtering to out a number of smaller stops for more graphical clarity. 

```{r}
pdx_stops <- left_join(gtfs$stops,am_freq, by="stop_id")
stop_departures <- pdx_stops %>%  
  group_by(stop_name) %>%
  mutate(total_departures=sum(departures, na.rm=TRUE))
stop_departures <- right_join(pdx_stops_sf,
                        stop_departures, by="stop_name")
```

Finally, we can plot both the route line counts and the stop departure counts on one map:

```{r}
leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles('CartoDB.Positron') %>%
  addPolylines(data = routes_sf,color='red',opacity = 0.25,
               weight =~ total_departures/100) %>%
  addCircleMarkers(data=stop_departures,color='blue',fillOpacity = 0.5,
                   radius =~ total_departures/10,weight = NA)
```

# Headways over Time

We can also plot frequency at different times of day, rather than over geographic space. To keep it simpler, we will do this for just one service pattern, as above. 

```{r, fig.height=25,fig.width=10}

#Filter for service IDs in the service pattern of interest.

# Wrap Up

There is a lot you can do with GTFS data -- our transit dashboards we have built for TriMet and are building for other agencies heavily rely on the standardization of GTFS. They provide great datasets to test the R skills you are learning on for something very relevant to our work! Remix outputs scenarios developed in the tool directly in GTFS. Drafting up new transit services in a GTFS-like format can help you to compare existing service with new service. There are a lot of ideas to explore in your work with GTFS, and R makes handling the multiple tables and the spatial/aspatial nature of GTFS easier.
